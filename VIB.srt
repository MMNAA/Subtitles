1
00:01:14,124 --> 00:01:19,198
A long, long time ago,
Nosferatu, the undead,

2
00:01:19,285 --> 00:01:22,674
the race of the vampire,
were driven from Egypt.

3
00:01:22,764 --> 00:01:25,325
Most fled to the mountains
of Transylvania

4
00:01:25,404 --> 00:01:28,077
but others of better taste,
including myself,

5
00:01:28,164 --> 00:01:31,440
travelled south through Africa
and over the Atlantic

6
00:01:31,525 --> 00:01:34,516
to a beautiful island
in the Bermuda Triangle.

7
00:01:34,604 --> 00:01:38,961
There we lived for happy centuries
feasting on the blood of travellers,

8
00:01:39,045 --> 00:01:42,037
until discovered by the hunters
once again.

9
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:45,401
Then, the blood that spilled
was our own.

10
00:01:47,485 --> 00:01:52,081
l alone escaped but a vampire alone
is a vampire doomed.

11
00:01:52,165 --> 00:01:56,124
My only chance was to find
the one known offspring of our tribe

12
00:01:56,205 --> 00:01:59,003
that had been born
in a foreign land -

13
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:02,634
a woman somewhere in this place
called Brooklyn.

14
00:02:12,486 --> 00:02:17,116
Family Feud brings you the world's
first War Of The Showgirls!

15
00:02:17,206 --> 00:02:21,039
Atlantic City versus Las Vegas.

16
00:02:21,126 --> 00:02:25,563
Here's my show! Come on, baby,
you make me excited.

17
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:37,917
Name something a playboy
might have made out of silk.

18
00:02:50,286 --> 00:02:51,685
Sheets!

19
00:02:56,967 --> 00:03:00,800
- She ain't gonna get it.
- Put me down for ten on the Knicks.

20
00:03:00,887 --> 00:03:04,641
You betting on the Knicks?
When will you learn?

21
00:03:08,686 --> 00:03:13,477
Call me! l'm gonna take you for
an eight-piece special with biscuit!

22
00:03:16,927 --> 00:03:20,124
Sheets, baby. Sheets!
You make me excited.

23
00:03:20,207 --> 00:03:22,516
Come on down.

24
00:03:29,647 --> 00:03:31,559
S-H-E-E-T. Sheets!

25
00:03:32,448 --> 00:03:35,326
- That's what l'm talking about!
- Oh, shit.

26
00:03:35,407 --> 00:03:38,161
- The bitch said it!
- Let me see...sheets!

27
00:03:44,728 --> 00:03:47,401
Earthquake! Earthquake!

28
00:03:47,488 --> 00:03:50,366
This ain't no earthquake,
this is New York, fool!

29
00:03:51,808 --> 00:03:53,958
What was that?

30
00:03:56,848 --> 00:03:59,442
- Oh, shit!
- What the fuck is going on?

31
00:03:59,528 --> 00:04:01,359
What the hell happened?

32
00:04:01,448 --> 00:04:05,488
ls this how people come,
disrespecting your shit, man?

33
00:04:05,568 --> 00:04:07,685
Ain't that a bitch? What...?

34
00:04:08,769 --> 00:04:10,680
lt's a bird!

35
00:04:10,768 --> 00:04:15,239
Get the hell away from me! Good God,
what the hell's happening here?

36
00:04:22,168 --> 00:04:25,206
Damn. Look at this ugly thing.

37
00:04:26,448 --> 00:04:30,328
Who the hell's piloting this vessel,
Stevie fucking Wonder?!

38
00:04:33,409 --> 00:04:37,163
Must be a DUl.
l don't see no lights.

39
00:04:37,249 --> 00:04:40,685
l don't see no people, either.
Damn, look at the time!

40
00:04:40,769 --> 00:04:44,126
l gotta bounce, Unc,
l'm supposed to be at my lady's crib.

41
00:04:44,209 --> 00:04:47,282
- Julius, bring your ass back here!
- l don't know about this!

42
00:04:47,369 --> 00:04:50,202
l run numbers,
you check out spooky-ass ships!

43
00:04:50,289 --> 00:04:52,599
- Go ahead with your bad self.
- Chump!

44
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:55,044
l'm not supposed to be scared, huh?

45
00:04:57,409 --> 00:05:00,163
Ahoy there! Hello!

46
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:05,281
Ahoy, motherfucker!

47
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:09,005
Son of a bitch.

48
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:13,527
Oh, y'all the silent type?

49
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:16,488
Well, somebody's
gonna buy me a new TV!

50
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:18,367
16-inch colour.

51
00:05:21,051 --> 00:05:24,122
Ahoy there! You in there, somebody?

52
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:27,405
ls this a joke?

53
00:05:30,091 --> 00:05:32,400
Ahoy!

54
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:36,643
Arrogant motherfuckers in here
don't wanna say nothin'. Shit.

55
00:05:36,731 --> 00:05:39,528
l'm too old for this shit. Ahoy!

56
00:05:41,371 --> 00:05:43,123
Hello.

57
00:05:54,091 --> 00:05:56,651
Help me! Help me!

58
00:06:00,571 --> 00:06:03,039
Oh, help, somebody! Help me!

59
00:06:03,131 --> 00:06:04,962
Help me, please.

60
00:06:22,892 --> 00:06:26,646
That sure as hell wasn't Lassie.
Big motherfucker!

61
00:06:32,972 --> 00:06:34,564
Jesus, Mary and Jo-Jo.

62
00:06:40,453 --> 00:06:42,602
Jesus, Mary and Jo-Jo!

63
00:06:52,253 --> 00:06:53,924
Get the hell outta here!

64
00:06:55,612 --> 00:06:58,571
Don't be bringing
your nappy black ass back here!

65
00:06:58,652 --> 00:07:02,965
- My Adidas! Damn, what'd l do?
- You was snorin'!

66
00:07:04,053 --> 00:07:07,250
- Everybody snores!
- Not while they fuckin'!

67
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:11,292
- Piece of trash!
- Eva, come back! l was restin'!

68
00:07:11,373 --> 00:07:12,772
Rest this!

69
00:07:12,853 --> 00:07:16,971
You'll be beggin' me back tomorrow.
That's all right.

70
00:07:17,054 --> 00:07:20,125
- That's Julius. He owes you money?
- l see him.

71
00:07:20,214 --> 00:07:22,808
Oh, shit. Pizza Man.

72
00:07:24,894 --> 00:07:27,886
- Comin' through!
- l'll get you!

73
00:07:27,973 --> 00:07:31,090
You better run! l'm coming after you!

74
00:07:31,173 --> 00:07:32,732
Run, baby. Run!

75
00:07:32,813 --> 00:07:36,523
l'm comin' after you, baby!
Yeah! l want you!

76
00:07:37,613 --> 00:07:39,525
Hey, get off my hood, man!

77
00:07:45,334 --> 00:07:47,643
- Mind if l borrow your hat?
- Go ahead.

78
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:49,452
Thank you.

79
00:07:50,494 --> 00:07:52,689
Come on. Hey, man.

80
00:07:52,774 --> 00:07:55,846
Ain't as fast as you used to be,
huh, Julius?

81
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:58,733
- Tony, l didn't know it was you.
- Are you mental?

82
00:07:58,814 --> 00:08:03,569
How many times have l gotta tell you?
l'm Anthony. He's Tony.

83
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:07,453
Oh, yeah, that's Tony. Right.

84
00:08:09,014 --> 00:08:11,893
You know. All you gumbas
look alike to me.

85
00:08:17,415 --> 00:08:19,292
- You got our money?
- Yeah.

86
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:23,765
- Oh, shit. l had it a minute ago.
- Then you're a minute too late.

87
00:08:24,815 --> 00:08:26,931
You don't have to do that to me.

88
00:08:27,015 --> 00:08:30,724
- Who'll take care of my kids?
- You don't have any kids.

89
00:08:30,815 --> 00:08:32,533
l'll start.

90
00:08:32,616 --> 00:08:36,005
Don't worry about it, Julius.
Nobody's gonna miss you.

91
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:37,210
Do it.

92
00:08:37,296 --> 00:08:40,253
l wouldn't do that.
You might miss the heart.

93
00:08:40,335 --> 00:08:43,771
You aim between the eyes,
that way you get a nice, even spray.

94
00:08:43,855 --> 00:08:46,848
- What the hell?
- Who the fuck are you?

95
00:08:46,935 --> 00:08:50,053
l'm Maximillian, a connoisseur
of death, you might say.

96
00:08:50,135 --> 00:08:52,206
No one takes pride in the art,

97
00:08:52,296 --> 00:08:55,413
it's so rare you come across
a clean kill nowadays.

98
00:08:55,495 --> 00:08:57,486
You got two seconds to beat it

99
00:08:57,576 --> 00:09:00,568
or you're gonna share a coffin
with Carl Lewis.

100
00:09:00,656 --> 00:09:04,444
- l already have a coffin of my own.
- Come on.

101
00:09:08,176 --> 00:09:12,692
- He's no fun. He fell right over.
- Some fuckin' wackos in this town.

102
00:09:12,776 --> 00:09:14,414
Let's get back to you, Julius.

103
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,610
l guess you're
out of bullets, huh, man?

104
00:09:18,697 --> 00:09:21,210
No, l kept one special just for you.

105
00:09:22,656 --> 00:09:24,931
lnteresting.

106
00:09:25,017 --> 00:09:28,930
l've been stabbed
and l've been hanged

107
00:09:29,017 --> 00:09:32,213
and l've been burned,
even broken on the rack once,

108
00:09:32,297 --> 00:09:34,810
but l've never been shot before.

109
00:09:37,736 --> 00:09:42,128
lt kind of itches a little.
You have quite decent aim, though.

110
00:09:45,617 --> 00:09:47,369
But next time...

111
00:09:52,097 --> 00:09:54,088
put a little heart into it.

112
00:10:08,498 --> 00:10:10,648
Oh, shit!

113
00:10:10,737 --> 00:10:12,648
Don't go away.

114
00:10:15,977 --> 00:10:20,176
He's gonna get it with the gun!
No, don't!

115
00:10:25,938 --> 00:10:27,530
Holy shit!

116
00:10:40,938 --> 00:10:42,895
He ain't gonna get me!

117
00:10:48,178 --> 00:10:52,138
l've seen it all. l'm getting my ass
the hell out of Brooklyn.

118
00:10:52,219 --> 00:10:54,937
l'm going to the islands,
somewhere peaceful.

119
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:58,375
Coney lsland.
Ryker's lsland. Devil's lsland.

120
00:11:03,139 --> 00:11:07,018
- Let me light that for you.
- Oh, shit!

121
00:11:10,779 --> 00:11:13,373
Hey, yo, l don't know
how you know me but...

122
00:11:13,459 --> 00:11:16,417
everything is everything,
l ain't seen nothing.

123
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,569
So you jump back
through the window

124
00:11:18,659 --> 00:11:21,652
cos l ain't really seen you,
l'm blind!

125
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:25,938
l got cataracts, l mean contacts.
l got astigmatism, man. l'm blind.

126
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,295
Where you at? See? Where you at?

127
00:11:30,179 --> 00:11:34,173
l saw you at the docks.
You're a liar, a thief and a cheat.

128
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,853
No, that's my brother Miles.
l'm honest.

129
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:40,693
Well, that's unfortunate because
that's what l liked about you.

130
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:49,052
Hey, easy, bro. You ain't got to
pull that Blacula shit with me.

131
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:53,418
lf you're hungry, l'll run you down
the KFC and get you a two-piece.

132
00:11:59,141 --> 00:12:01,530
l already had ltalian.

133
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,452
You're going to make me think
you don't like me.

134
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:13,180
Wouldn't want to do that,
now, would we?

135
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:17,336
l got nothing but love for you, baby.

136
00:12:17,421 --> 00:12:20,811
Hey, what the fuck are you doing?

137
00:12:20,901 --> 00:12:23,131
Welcome to the party, Julius.

138
00:12:23,221 --> 00:12:26,179
- Oh, shit!
- lt hurts, doesn't it?

139
00:12:26,261 --> 00:12:30,015
Pain is an underrated experience
but it happens to be my speciality

140
00:12:30,101 --> 00:12:33,332
and like it or not,
you belong to me now.

141
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:39,576
H-hey, bro, why you do that?
lt feels kinda...kinda right.

142
00:12:40,941 --> 00:12:44,172
Because l need your eyes in the day
and your services at night.

143
00:12:44,262 --> 00:12:46,491
But first l need my coffin. Come!

144
00:12:50,702 --> 00:12:52,613
Wait! Where you going?

145
00:12:52,701 --> 00:12:55,774
What's up?
You ain't gonna be sucking my neck?

146
00:12:55,862 --> 00:12:59,571
Why? You're my ghoul now.
l need you to help me find a woman.

147
00:12:59,662 --> 00:13:02,972
A woman? You came to the right spot.
Brooklyn's full of hos.

148
00:13:03,062 --> 00:13:06,498
l'm not interested in your hos.
l'm looking for a special woman,

149
00:13:06,582 --> 00:13:09,699
one of my kind,
the only one like her in the world.

150
00:13:09,782 --> 00:13:14,060
As l've come to her, she'll soon
come to me like a moth to a flame.

151
00:13:14,142 --> 00:13:16,815
So you're checking for
a vampster bitch?

152
00:13:16,903 --> 00:13:19,894
Half vampire
and she's ignorant of it.

153
00:13:19,982 --> 00:13:22,543
The other half sleepwalks
in humanity

154
00:13:22,622 --> 00:13:26,059
but l can cure that if
l find her before the next full moon.

155
00:13:26,142 --> 00:13:29,658
- Here?
- Yes, here. Somewhere in Brooklyn.

156
00:13:35,143 --> 00:13:39,933
This night shift is kicking my ass.
How come you never get tired?

157
00:13:40,023 --> 00:13:43,333
l've always been
more of a night person myself.

158
00:13:43,423 --> 00:13:45,937
This is a good one, listen up now.

159
00:13:46,023 --> 00:13:50,255
''Your faith will be tested
as a loved one dances with death.

160
00:13:50,343 --> 00:13:52,811
''Beware the dark stranger

161
00:13:52,903 --> 00:13:57,021
''and when all's lost,
look to your soul for the answers.''

162
00:13:57,103 --> 00:14:01,779
- l wouldn't wanna be you this week.
- This is your horoscope, not mine.

163
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:05,221
That's my horoscope? Oh, shit.

164
00:14:12,344 --> 00:14:15,141
We have no information
on the cause of death

165
00:14:15,224 --> 00:14:18,455
but all bodies so far
seem drained of blood.

166
00:14:26,144 --> 00:14:30,057
- What the hell is this, Captain?
- Love Boat came in a few hours ago.

167
00:14:30,144 --> 00:14:33,056
There was 18 that we know of.
Whole gang's DOA.

168
00:14:33,145 --> 00:14:35,181
Aw, jeez. Ship's log?

169
00:14:35,264 --> 00:14:38,461
Sort of - half rotten
and it's in a strange language.

170
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:41,342
Sent it to NYU
to see if they could figure it out.

171
00:14:41,424 --> 00:14:45,542
- Witnesses?
- Night watchman, Silas Green.

172
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:48,059
Let him tell you
what he thinks he saw.

173
00:14:48,145 --> 00:14:50,215
All right.

174
00:14:51,585 --> 00:14:54,099
- Hey, Rita.
- Hey.

175
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:57,860
- How's your new partner holding up?
- She's cool, she just needs time.

176
00:14:57,944 --> 00:15:00,175
She's had three months already.

177
00:15:00,264 --> 00:15:04,816
l know her mother just died in
a nuthouse but she's got a job to do.

178
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:07,373
She's a good cop.
She'll surprise you.

179
00:15:07,465 --> 00:15:10,184
That's what l'm afraid of.

180
00:15:12,305 --> 00:15:14,296
- l got it.
- Kinda narrow here.

181
00:15:14,385 --> 00:15:16,899
- Watch your step, lady.
- Excuse me.

182
00:15:16,985 --> 00:15:20,057
My back is killing me.
How many more we got?

183
00:15:20,145 --> 00:15:22,102
15 of them left.

184
00:15:24,066 --> 00:15:28,502
- Careful there.
- Give me your light.

185
00:15:28,586 --> 00:15:31,419
You need a cast-iron stomach.

186
00:15:36,706 --> 00:15:39,140
So you say you saw a...a what?

187
00:15:39,225 --> 00:15:42,184
lt was a wolf, goddammit!
Big, black-ass wolf!

188
00:15:42,266 --> 00:15:45,338
Motherfucker jumped off the boat,
ran over there

189
00:15:45,426 --> 00:15:50,420
and the son of a bitch turned into
a man! Did the flip-flop shit on me!

190
00:15:50,506 --> 00:15:53,464
Just like a whore l knew
in Detroit in '62, '63.

191
00:15:53,546 --> 00:15:55,980
l'd go over her house Saturday night,

192
00:15:56,066 --> 00:16:01,823
l come through the door,
she's a man! Flip-floppin' and shit!

193
00:16:01,907 --> 00:16:06,855
You ever had a motherfucker flip-flop
on you, going crazy and shit?

194
00:16:06,947 --> 00:16:09,700
So the wolf you saw
looked something like that?

195
00:16:09,786 --> 00:16:14,781
The wolf? That's a chihuahua compared
to the motherfucker come at me!

196
00:16:14,866 --> 00:16:17,097
You're crazy. You seen a wolf, man?

197
00:16:17,187 --> 00:16:19,336
- Yeah.
- To the 25th power!

198
00:16:19,427 --> 00:16:21,543
You people belong behind the line!

199
00:16:21,627 --> 00:16:24,699
- Hey, B, where's your coffin at?
- lt's on the boat.

200
00:16:24,787 --> 00:16:29,065
On the boat? Shit, we can't
get it now, look at all these cops.

201
00:16:29,147 --> 00:16:33,619
And you people, you people better
keep back. Killer loves to bite.

202
00:16:35,147 --> 00:16:38,025
And so do l. Jump!

203
00:16:42,547 --> 00:16:44,538
Killer?

204
00:16:48,228 --> 00:16:52,267
- Here...here, boy.
- Oh, shit. Lovely, dude.

205
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:17,297
Hello.

206
00:17:17,388 --> 00:17:19,504
Someone here?!

207
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:30,580
lt's you.

208
00:18:40,151 --> 00:18:41,743
Someone there?

209
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:45,066
Shit. Damn!

210
00:18:54,271 --> 00:18:56,500
- Chill. lt's just me.
- Shit!

211
00:18:56,591 --> 00:18:59,981
- Did you see him?
- There's nobody here but us.

212
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:04,863
Someone's here. l saw him or it.

213
00:19:04,951 --> 00:19:09,263
lt? What the fuck...
hey, what's wrong with you?

214
00:19:09,351 --> 00:19:11,307
There's a coffin.

215
00:19:13,872 --> 00:19:16,385
ln here, come on.
Right in there. Look.

216
00:19:17,271 --> 00:19:19,705
What? l don't see anything.

217
00:19:22,191 --> 00:19:25,741
- l-l could've sworn...
- Rita, are you OK?

218
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:27,823
l'm fine. Absolutely fine!

219
00:19:27,912 --> 00:19:33,225
Good, cos that's exactly what l told
Captain Dewey - absolutely fine.

220
00:19:33,311 --> 00:19:35,542
- Right.
- You all right?

221
00:19:36,311 --> 00:19:38,382
Let me out of here.

222
00:19:43,712 --> 00:19:46,067
What is that?

223
00:19:57,152 --> 00:19:59,143
lt's an ear.

224
00:19:59,232 --> 00:20:01,302
A rotted-off human ear.

225
00:20:03,472 --> 00:20:05,543
Yeah, but my ear? Look!

226
00:20:05,632 --> 00:20:08,066
My fucking ear done fell off!

227
00:20:08,152 --> 00:20:10,109
You've another on the other side.

228
00:20:10,192 --> 00:20:14,151
Besides, the benefits of
being a ghoul outweigh the drawbacks.

229
00:20:14,233 --> 00:20:17,430
What benefits?
Benefit my fucking ear back on!

230
00:20:17,513 --> 00:20:20,425
You put me in the monster union?
l'm on Blue Cross?

231
00:20:20,513 --> 00:20:22,708
l meant Blue Shield, brother.

232
00:20:22,793 --> 00:20:25,990
l have taken refuge
in some sorry places...

233
00:20:26,073 --> 00:20:29,429
This is a bargain.
My Uncle Silas is the landlord...

234
00:20:29,513 --> 00:20:31,869
What the hell
is all this damn noise?

235
00:20:32,913 --> 00:20:35,108
Julius, is that you?

236
00:20:35,194 --> 00:20:38,311
- lt's me.
- You little scared piece of shit.

237
00:20:38,393 --> 00:20:41,988
l ought to whoop your ass
for booking out on me.

238
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:45,383
- You wouldn't believe what l saw.
- Oh, l bet you l would.

239
00:20:45,474 --> 00:20:49,262
Nobody believes me.
l know a big-ass wolf when l see one!

240
00:20:49,354 --> 00:20:52,824
- What the hell's going on?!
- Just...

241
00:20:52,914 --> 00:20:54,745
Who's that?

242
00:20:54,834 --> 00:20:57,667
- That's my boss.
- You got a job?

243
00:20:58,634 --> 00:21:02,183
What do you mean? Of course
l got a job! l got a good job, too.

244
00:21:02,274 --> 00:21:05,584
- He just need a place to lay low.
- Rent's double.

245
00:21:05,674 --> 00:21:07,904
- No, what?
- Triple.

246
00:21:07,994 --> 00:21:12,033
- You know you missing an ear?
- That's just a trick l'm working on.

247
00:21:12,114 --> 00:21:14,947
You can't triple the rent. You got...

248
00:21:16,834 --> 00:21:20,793
Night started off like shit but...
end up pretty good.

249
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:23,911
l don't turn nothing down
but my collar. Howdy do.

250
00:21:23,995 --> 00:21:26,554
Welcome. Trash man comes on Tuesdays.

251
00:21:26,635 --> 00:21:29,274
God loves you, God loves me, bye.

252
00:21:33,275 --> 00:21:36,392
Good thing you ran into me.
l'll hook you up.

253
00:21:36,475 --> 00:21:40,831
l'll make sure everything we do
is gonna be right.

254
00:21:40,915 --> 00:21:45,067
First, we in Brooklyn now, man.
You gotta get rid of this thing.

255
00:21:46,155 --> 00:21:47,793
You ever heard of a futon?

256
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:52,153
Lighter, comfortabler, better
for your back, good to fuck on.

257
00:21:52,235 --> 00:21:55,750
You gonna scratch your ass
fucking on this.

258
00:21:57,196 --> 00:21:58,948
A couple of things to know.

259
00:21:59,035 --> 00:22:01,550
One, never sit on my coffin.

260
00:22:01,635 --> 00:22:03,752
Two, l want to find the girl tonight!

261
00:22:03,835 --> 00:22:06,304
Sounds good, yeah. ls there a three?

262
00:22:09,836 --> 00:22:12,190
l don't like mirrors!

263
00:22:18,756 --> 00:22:20,712
Got it.

264
00:22:40,677 --> 00:22:42,985
Maybe l am going crazy.

265
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:47,392
What's happening to me?

266
00:23:54,118 --> 00:23:58,112
Justice, it's not just the bodies
or the ear, l got a feeling.

267
00:23:58,198 --> 00:24:01,986
You got a feeling about everything
and what do l say?

268
00:24:02,078 --> 00:24:03,909
''Everything by the book.''

269
00:24:03,998 --> 00:24:07,911
But if it ain't in the book,
going by the book won't solve it.

270
00:24:07,998 --> 00:24:11,070
All l'm saying is
give something to intuition.

271
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:15,152
We've got a development
in that boat-people mess.

272
00:24:15,239 --> 00:24:18,948
A couple of stiffs on Bates Street.
One guy was ripped to pieces.

273
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:22,076
- What about the other guy?
- He's in one piece

274
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:27,153
- except he's missing a heart.
- Two blocks from the docks.

275
00:24:27,239 --> 00:24:30,755
- Very good.
- What about the ship's log?

276
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:34,879
The university couldn't make sense
of it so they sent it to this Dr...

277
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,478
Zeko.
Apparently, some sort of specialist.

278
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:42,348
- Zeko. What's the address?
- 315 South Rockaway.

279
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:46,558
That's a tough neighbourhood.
What kind of doctor is he?

280
00:24:46,639 --> 00:24:49,028
l don't know,
maybe he's a heart specialist.

281
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:51,839
- Let's check it out.
- l didn't finish my coffee.

282
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,275
Take it with you. Go. Come on.

283
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:58,194
Captain, here's
the latest figures on the boat.

284
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,472
Zeko's, huh? Yeah, l got me the 41 1 .

285
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,759
l got the info and a Happy Meal.

286
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,438
Good!

287
00:25:23,201 --> 00:25:25,032
Things were progressing well.

288
00:25:25,121 --> 00:25:28,032
Rita's vision of herself
dead in my coffin

289
00:25:28,121 --> 00:25:31,557
was a certain sign
she was destined to be my mate.

290
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:39,393
Even my ghoul was performing well
those duties only a ghoul can do

291
00:25:39,481 --> 00:25:43,713
when the cursed sun drives a vampire
to the shelter of his coffin.

292
00:25:43,801 --> 00:25:47,555
ln return, he would enjoy
all the perks of ghouldom,

293
00:25:47,641 --> 00:25:52,351
maybe someday make vampire himself,
all with only minor side effects.

294
00:25:58,162 --> 00:25:59,754
Shit! What...

295
00:25:59,841 --> 00:26:03,596
What are you...
What are you doing sitting there?

296
00:26:03,681 --> 00:26:07,675
- You got the dropsies, l think.
- Got no dropsies.

297
00:26:07,762 --> 00:26:12,152
So, tell me, uh...tell me
what you think of these wheels.

298
00:26:12,241 --> 00:26:16,154
l say lucky it's an automatic
cos you don't have enough hands

299
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:19,040
to shift and drive
at the same damn time.

300
00:26:21,842 --> 00:26:24,595
- A wedding?
- A funeral.

301
00:26:24,682 --> 00:26:27,515
- Very nice touch.
- l knew you'd like it.

302
00:26:29,442 --> 00:26:33,401
l used to look like that in '62.
Same hair. Same clothes.

303
00:26:33,482 --> 00:26:35,678
Stop harassing the man.

304
00:26:35,762 --> 00:26:38,993
lf l was you,
l'd take a dick check quick.

305
00:26:41,122 --> 00:26:43,842
lt's all there. lt's all there.

306
00:26:43,922 --> 00:26:47,154
Thank God for small favours,
and l do mean small.

307
00:26:47,243 --> 00:26:49,279
See that?

308
00:26:51,683 --> 00:26:53,833
Young punk.

309
00:26:53,922 --> 00:26:57,711
Max, why didn't you bite this bitch
when you had the chance?

310
00:26:57,803 --> 00:27:00,920
She has to give herself to me
voluntarily.

311
00:27:01,003 --> 00:27:02,959
Hey, this is Brooklyn, baby.

312
00:27:03,043 --> 00:27:07,640
Don't nobody give up shit unless you
got some cold cash or a hot slug.

313
00:27:07,723 --> 00:27:11,602
ln this case, l know more about her
than she knows about herself.

314
00:27:11,683 --> 00:27:14,959
One dance with me, one dance,
and she'll be mine.

315
00:27:15,043 --> 00:27:18,639
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Now you're talking, player.

316
00:27:18,723 --> 00:27:22,956
l bet you dance that Hammer shit.
Show me what you gonna do

317
00:27:23,044 --> 00:27:25,113
when you get in there.

318
00:27:25,204 --> 00:27:29,994
Show me that old Hammer shit you
gonna do. That's some good shit, man.

319
00:27:30,084 --> 00:27:33,519
Am l gonna be able to disappear
in the mirror too?

320
00:27:37,004 --> 00:27:40,713
l'm warning you. Drive the limo
and shut your fucking mouth.

321
00:27:40,804 --> 00:27:43,762
- Shut up!
- Hey, man, not while l'm driving!

322
00:27:43,844 --> 00:27:46,312
- Shut the fuck up!
- Shit! l'm driving...

323
00:27:46,404 --> 00:27:49,874
- Goddammit!
- ..and you give me a brain aneurysm?

324
00:27:52,444 --> 00:27:53,593
You put somebody eye out!

325
00:27:56,205 --> 00:28:00,483
l had the lab do a check on that
seaweed that was all over the boat.

326
00:28:00,564 --> 00:28:04,797
Seems that type only grows
in an isolated area of the Caribbean.

327
00:28:04,885 --> 00:28:07,035
Caribbean?

328
00:28:08,165 --> 00:28:11,680
My mother did her studies down there
before she had me.

329
00:28:11,765 --> 00:28:14,403
How come you don't talk about
your mother?

330
00:28:14,485 --> 00:28:16,794
The paper said she was incredible.

331
00:28:16,885 --> 00:28:20,798
There's nothing to talk about.
l never really knew her.

332
00:28:20,885 --> 00:28:25,242
She flipped. They stuck her in
the institution, me in a foster home.

333
00:28:25,325 --> 00:28:29,603
- How'd your father handle it?
- He didn't.

334
00:28:29,685 --> 00:28:33,156
He was murdered down in the islands
before l was born.

335
00:28:33,246 --> 00:28:37,558
l wish l had known him,
at least something about him but...

336
00:28:37,646 --> 00:28:39,442
- Wait a minute.
- What?

337
00:28:41,565 --> 00:28:47,038
- lf we're right, that's Dr Zeko's.
- That's one funky doctor's office.

338
00:28:59,126 --> 00:29:01,765
- So where is this guy?
- l don't know.

339
00:29:01,846 --> 00:29:04,679
- Closer than you think.
- Dr Zeko, l'm...

340
00:29:04,767 --> 00:29:07,838
l know who you are
and why you're here.

341
00:29:11,686 --> 00:29:13,961
You know where this ship came from?

342
00:29:14,046 --> 00:29:17,596
Any one of 100 isles
in the swells of the Sargasso Sea,

343
00:29:17,687 --> 00:29:20,360
in an area you call
the Bermuda Triangle.

344
00:29:20,447 --> 00:29:23,166
- Sit down.
- The Bermuda Triangle?

345
00:29:23,246 --> 00:29:25,602
Dr Zeko, what does the log say?

346
00:29:25,687 --> 00:29:29,918
lt spoke of a voyage
filled with sickness and nightmares.

347
00:29:30,007 --> 00:29:33,761
- They believed an evil was aboard.
- An evil?

348
00:29:33,847 --> 00:29:36,361
l thought they killed
the last of them

349
00:29:36,447 --> 00:29:40,201
but these men warn us from beyond -
he is here.

350
00:29:40,287 --> 00:29:41,686
He?

351
00:29:43,767 --> 00:29:48,079
Nosferatu. The undead. The vampire.

352
00:29:49,527 --> 00:29:52,088
Look, nothing personal, my man,

353
00:29:52,167 --> 00:29:55,557
but this is a murder investigation,
not a witch-hunt.

354
00:29:55,648 --> 00:29:59,527
Now, that boat's crew are sleeping
at the morgue, they are not...

355
00:29:59,607 --> 00:30:02,406
cruising the boulevard sucking necks.

356
00:30:04,048 --> 00:30:07,438
The world is full of false notions,
Detective.

357
00:30:07,527 --> 00:30:11,282
Vampires are a race, not a club
you join by being bitten.

358
00:30:11,368 --> 00:30:14,644
Yeah, yeah, a race, not a club.

359
00:30:14,728 --> 00:30:17,117
- Of course(!)
- Beware, Detective.

360
00:30:17,208 --> 00:30:21,406
This is more deadly
than anything your job has shown you.

361
00:30:21,488 --> 00:30:25,481
A vampire has no mercy, no regrets.
He can change shapes.

362
00:30:25,568 --> 00:30:29,528
He could be sitting next to us now
and we wouldn't even know it.

363
00:30:29,608 --> 00:30:32,998
Yeah, well, l would know it.
Rita, l'm gonna call in.

364
00:30:34,168 --> 00:30:36,124
All right.

365
00:30:40,168 --> 00:30:43,479
Dr Zeko, how do you know so much
about this?

366
00:30:43,569 --> 00:30:45,524
On my island...

367
00:30:46,768 --> 00:30:49,237
l faced one over a woman.

368
00:30:50,328 --> 00:30:54,527
l lost. She was taken.

369
00:30:55,929 --> 00:30:59,205
Here's my best advice
and please listen carefully.

370
00:31:00,289 --> 00:31:05,317
Keep your faith, Rita.
lf l know one thing, it's this -

371
00:31:05,409 --> 00:31:08,082
you'll need it.

372
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:34,164
Do you have a problem, pal?

373
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:37,845
- There's a killer on the loose.
- You don't say.

374
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:42,488
And what might you know about him?

375
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:44,526
Well, he's very smart, very quick

376
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:48,125
- and quite deadly.
- Do you know where this killer is?

377
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:50,485
He's right behind you.

378
00:31:54,571 --> 00:31:57,926
- lt's all right.
- Oh, l'm gonna die.

379
00:31:58,011 --> 00:31:59,921
No, not quite yet.

380
00:32:01,571 --> 00:32:03,960
They're very much like us, you see...

381
00:32:05,731 --> 00:32:08,450
misunderstood.

382
00:32:11,891 --> 00:32:15,406
Sorry. This never happened before.

383
00:32:18,971 --> 00:32:21,087
That's unbelievable.

384
00:32:21,171 --> 00:32:24,642
- Thank God you were here.
- God had nothing to do with it.

385
00:32:24,731 --> 00:32:29,566
- l'm Max.
- Rita. Rita Veder.

386
00:32:36,291 --> 00:32:38,010
l think...

387
00:32:48,131 --> 00:32:50,964
You know, l know
this is gonna sound like a line

388
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:54,601
but l really feel like l've seen you
somewhere before.

389
00:32:55,932 --> 00:33:00,926
- Do you believe in the supernatural?
- l might.

390
00:33:01,772 --> 00:33:04,366
Well, l had this dream...

391
00:33:04,452 --> 00:33:06,603
What kind of dream?

392
00:33:08,092 --> 00:33:10,686
There was a beautiful woman...

393
00:33:10,772 --> 00:33:14,845
a woman with a smile so lovely
it could brighten the darkest night.

394
00:33:16,612 --> 00:33:19,173
But she was trapped.

395
00:33:19,252 --> 00:33:23,087
She was trapped in a prison
where the moon never shined.

396
00:33:23,173 --> 00:33:26,563
She couldn't escape
because she didn't know how.

397
00:33:26,652 --> 00:33:30,407
And then l came and l set her free.

398
00:33:32,653 --> 00:33:34,564
Did you?

399
00:33:34,653 --> 00:33:38,885
The woman was you, Rita.
l recognise you.

400
00:33:41,493 --> 00:33:43,051
Well...

401
00:33:44,813 --> 00:33:46,769
How did you set me free?

402
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:51,810
l set you free with a dance.

403
00:33:53,493 --> 00:33:56,132
Let me show you.

404
00:33:57,373 --> 00:33:59,125
Come.

405
00:34:09,494 --> 00:34:13,407
What am l thinking? l can't.
l'm on duty.

406
00:34:13,494 --> 00:34:18,409
On duty? Sounds like a personal
problem. Do you know who this is?

407
00:34:18,494 --> 00:34:22,089
This ain't Nick Ashford,
this is Maximillian, all right?

408
00:34:22,174 --> 00:34:26,645
This mofo's got a pussy surplus.
Solid as a rock!

409
00:34:26,734 --> 00:34:30,614
All right, fuck it, then.
He want to get it on with you, see?

410
00:34:30,694 --> 00:34:35,086
So just be nice and show my man some
respect cos he'll put it on with you.

411
00:34:35,175 --> 00:34:38,247
- She's straightened out, boss.
- l'm sorry.

412
00:34:38,335 --> 00:34:43,124
No. Who knew you were so popular?
But it's a good thing,

413
00:34:43,215 --> 00:34:46,651
cos l wouldn't dance with you
if you were the last man on earth.

414
00:34:46,735 --> 00:34:50,808
- You ready?
- Yeah. More than.

415
00:34:50,895 --> 00:34:54,683
- l'll see you again, Rita.
- ln your dreams, Max.

416
00:34:56,094 --> 00:35:00,486
- She's one of a kind.
- She is. Not your kind, though.

417
00:35:04,935 --> 00:35:08,008
Fuck them. l got these two...

418
00:35:10,295 --> 00:35:14,005
This tongue of yours
has complicated a very simple plan.

419
00:35:14,096 --> 00:35:17,725
lf it happens again,
l'll hang you with it, understand?

420
00:35:19,255 --> 00:35:22,088
l'll have to take drastic measures,
time is short.

421
00:35:22,176 --> 00:35:23,325
Hey, you the boss...

422
00:35:28,536 --> 00:35:32,927
Gimme a break. You saying some kind
of evil spirit stowed away on board?

423
00:35:33,016 --> 00:35:35,484
- What if l am, huh? You want cream?
- No.

424
00:35:35,576 --> 00:35:38,773
Dewey heard you,
she'd have you in a straitjacket.

425
00:35:38,856 --> 00:35:41,496
Sometimes l feel things, all right?

426
00:35:41,576 --> 00:35:44,648
Now, l didn't ask for it,
l don't understand it

427
00:35:44,736 --> 00:35:47,011
but you can't explain it all
by the book.

428
00:35:47,096 --> 00:35:50,691
You finally get a man back here
and you're gonna kick his ass.

429
00:35:50,776 --> 00:35:53,337
lnteresting approach.

430
00:35:53,416 --> 00:35:57,251
Uh, Justice,
this is my roommate, Nikki.

431
00:35:57,336 --> 00:35:59,851
Nikki, my partner, Justice.

432
00:35:59,937 --> 00:36:03,566
From the way y'all was arguing,
l'd swear you was in love.

433
00:36:03,657 --> 00:36:05,568
- No.
- Good.

434
00:36:05,657 --> 00:36:08,535
Look, l'm gonna go on
back to the crib, cos, um...

435
00:36:08,616 --> 00:36:12,007
- it's getting a little late and...
- Wait a minute.

436
00:36:12,097 --> 00:36:16,773
- You don't want the coffee?
- No, you can buy me some tomorrow.

437
00:36:16,857 --> 00:36:19,690
l've had my fill of superstition.

438
00:36:21,497 --> 00:36:24,137
Next we'll be seeing
little green men.

439
00:36:24,217 --> 00:36:28,529
Right. Sure, whatever, OK.
You can find your way out, right?

440
00:36:33,338 --> 00:36:35,329
You sure you don't want coffee?

441
00:36:35,418 --> 00:36:38,137
No, l'm breaking out.
Who painted this?

442
00:36:40,098 --> 00:36:41,929
That's Rita's.

443
00:36:45,138 --> 00:36:48,130
She paints things
she sees in her nightmares.

444
00:36:48,218 --> 00:36:52,336
Rita's got weird taste in art
but good taste in men.

445
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:55,137
lt's real late. Gotta go.

446
00:36:55,818 --> 00:36:57,137
Bye.

447
00:37:10,618 --> 00:37:15,932
Freud would say that if you leave
something this important behind,

448
00:37:16,019 --> 00:37:19,250
it means you really don't want to go.

449
00:37:22,059 --> 00:37:24,619
Two words - cold shower.

450
00:37:25,779 --> 00:37:27,336
Thank you.

451
00:37:37,819 --> 00:37:40,936
Now, he's obviously
a man of poor taste.

452
00:37:44,339 --> 00:37:46,614
My sentiments exactly.

453
00:37:49,899 --> 00:37:51,891
You sure ain't from around here.

454
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:55,650
Yes, you could say
l'm a long way from home.

455
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:01,618
Mine's upstairs. Would you like
to warm up with some coffee or...

456
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:04,338
some other refreshment?

457
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:11,255
But l wouldn't want to keep you up.

458
00:38:46,941 --> 00:38:50,331
Oh! Fuck me! Fuck me!

459
00:38:50,421 --> 00:38:54,380
Oh, baby. Say my name, baby.

460
00:38:57,821 --> 00:38:59,777
Keep it coming!

461
00:39:00,541 --> 00:39:02,497
l feel...l feel like...

462
00:39:07,062 --> 00:39:09,780
Damn you, Justice.

463
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:15,220
- Goddamn you.
- l'm coming!

464
00:39:15,302 --> 00:39:20,774
- l'm coming!
- l do not believe you.

465
00:39:25,862 --> 00:39:28,933
Let me see your face.
Let me see your face!

466
00:40:35,144 --> 00:40:38,898
This part of the seduction
is quite simple, really.

467
00:40:38,984 --> 00:40:44,058
Just take away everything she has,
then give her everything she needs.

468
00:40:44,143 --> 00:40:48,296
Rita. Girl, l finally found a man
who can make the room spin.

469
00:40:48,383 --> 00:40:50,739
Moving out
to find a place of my own,

470
00:40:50,824 --> 00:40:54,533
cos we're gonna need the room
to roam. Ciao baby, Nikki.

471
00:40:56,184 --> 00:40:58,015
Right.

472
00:40:59,064 --> 00:41:02,899
Oh yeah, you, like,
figure out what she's into

473
00:41:02,984 --> 00:41:05,134
and then fuck her head up with it?

474
00:41:05,224 --> 00:41:07,658
ln a manner of speaking, yes.

475
00:41:09,545 --> 00:41:12,662
But church.
She had to go to a church.

476
00:41:13,665 --> 00:41:18,580
My pops said the quickest way to a
woman's heart is through the church!

477
00:41:18,664 --> 00:41:21,418
lt's through the rib cage
but that's messy.

478
00:41:21,505 --> 00:41:24,941
No, there are much more
interesting ways to her heart.

479
00:41:25,025 --> 00:41:28,335
Through her fears, for instance,
or through her faith.

480
00:41:31,105 --> 00:41:34,780
- Excuse me.
- Just a second, son.

481
00:41:38,465 --> 00:41:40,023
Preacher...Pauley?

482
00:41:40,106 --> 00:41:44,179
And if you've been misbehavin',
Preacher Pauley's here for savin'.

483
00:41:44,265 --> 00:41:46,460
Well...

484
00:41:46,546 --> 00:41:49,013
l think that l'm beyond saving.

485
00:41:53,345 --> 00:41:56,497
- Going to church?
- l just wanna catch Preacher first,

486
00:41:56,586 --> 00:41:58,417
is he still in the parking lot?

487
00:42:07,866 --> 00:42:10,903
Preacher. l'm Preacher Pauley.

488
00:42:11,466 --> 00:42:16,062
Yes, how are you tonight? Rita Veder,
how are you tonight, girl?

489
00:42:16,146 --> 00:42:18,899
l've been tossing
about this case l'm on.

490
00:42:18,986 --> 00:42:21,944
- Tossin', right.
- l've been having these...

491
00:42:22,026 --> 00:42:24,745
really strange feelings.

492
00:42:24,827 --> 00:42:29,377
l felt l needed to talk to someone
that l could trust.

493
00:42:29,467 --> 00:42:33,618
You come to the right place.
Tossin' and havin' strange feelings.

494
00:42:33,706 --> 00:42:37,176
- And then l heard the voices.
- You heard voices.

495
00:42:37,266 --> 00:42:41,021
- Yes, like they were inside my head.
- ln your head?

496
00:42:41,106 --> 00:42:44,223
Really. Does this make sense?
ls it possible?

497
00:42:44,307 --> 00:42:46,582
You'd be surprised what's possible.

498
00:42:46,667 --> 00:42:51,297
l'm just afraid of ending up like
my mother, afraid l'm losing my mind.

499
00:42:51,387 --> 00:42:56,302
Afraid you're going crazy, that's
good. lt's good to get that out.

500
00:42:56,387 --> 00:43:00,460
You fear you're going crazy,
tell people. You need an outlet.

501
00:43:00,547 --> 00:43:03,380
- l get it out in my paintings.
- You paint?

502
00:43:03,467 --> 00:43:06,140
- Yes.
- lt's good to paint.

503
00:43:06,228 --> 00:43:08,866
You know, when l was young,
l used to paint...

504
00:43:08,947 --> 00:43:11,940
Preacher Pauley!
Come on. Everybody's waitin'.

505
00:43:12,028 --> 00:43:14,861
- l don't know if right now's...
- Go ahead.

506
00:43:14,947 --> 00:43:18,065
The Lord waits for no one.
Get your butt in here.

507
00:43:18,148 --> 00:43:20,866
Right now is not a good time!

508
00:43:27,148 --> 00:43:29,821
Goddamn!

509
00:43:32,388 --> 00:43:33,787
What did he say?

510
00:43:33,868 --> 00:43:37,781
God damns anybody
who doesn't glorify in His work!

511
00:43:37,868 --> 00:43:41,941
lt's a hell of a night outside.
Let's do the sermon on the lawn.

512
00:43:42,029 --> 00:43:45,782
Come on, sister. Goddamn!
Shit. Excuse me.

513
00:43:51,669 --> 00:43:55,025
Can we bring it down just a little,
please?

514
00:43:55,109 --> 00:43:59,307
Brothers and sisters,
please quiet down. Thank you.

515
00:43:59,388 --> 00:44:03,667
We come here time after time and
we talk about the same old same old.

516
00:44:03,749 --> 00:44:05,899
Hey, quiet down.

517
00:44:05,988 --> 00:44:09,584
- We talk about Jesus.
- That's right.

518
00:44:09,669 --> 00:44:12,502
Jesus said and Jesus wept.

519
00:44:12,589 --> 00:44:15,183
Jesus heard and Jesus walked over.

520
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:21,264
l don't wanna talk about Jesus.

521
00:44:21,349 --> 00:44:26,946
Cos as the big man teaches us,
there's two sides to every story.

522
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:30,624
Not one but two.
A story is not one-sided.

523
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:34,623
A story has duality.
There's two sides to every story.

524
00:44:35,709 --> 00:44:39,385
Which brings to mind the phrase
''necessary evil''.

525
00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:42,621
l know many of you
hear that phrase and say,

526
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:45,461
''That don't even make no sense to me.

527
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:49,384
''Can't be no such thing as
necessary - how's evil necessary?

528
00:44:49,469 --> 00:44:53,224
''That don't match. That's plaids
and stripes, evil and necessary.''

529
00:44:53,310 --> 00:44:57,747
You see, because without bad,
there is no good.

530
00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:02,744
Without light, there is no dark,
you need both these things.

531
00:45:02,830 --> 00:45:04,741
You hear what l'm saying?

532
00:45:04,830 --> 00:45:09,381
lf every day is a sunny day,
well, then, what's a sunny day?

533
00:45:09,470 --> 00:45:14,022
Well, the bottom line,
what l'm trying to tell you tonight,

534
00:45:14,110 --> 00:45:18,662
is that evil...eeeevil...
is necessary.

535
00:45:18,751 --> 00:45:23,381
Evil is necessary, thereby,
if it's necessary, evil...

536
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:25,939
- Evil...
- ..must be good.

537
00:45:26,031 --> 00:45:28,226
Evil is good.

538
00:45:30,311 --> 00:45:33,542
That's what l think.
Evil must be good, must be good.

539
00:45:33,631 --> 00:45:37,021
- Let me hear y'all say it...
- Evil is good.

540
00:45:37,111 --> 00:45:41,662
Evil is good. Take Brother Brown,
one of our strongest deacons,

541
00:45:41,752 --> 00:45:43,423
pillar of stability.

542
00:45:43,512 --> 00:45:48,062
Brother Brown was on Bushwick Avenue
last night with a two-dollar whore.

543
00:45:48,151 --> 00:45:50,984
- l didn't know she was no whore!
- You lyin' dog,

544
00:45:51,072 --> 00:45:54,427
- you said you was at your mother's.
- Now, that's evil.

545
00:45:54,512 --> 00:45:57,151
When you tell your wife,
''l'm going to see Mama,''

546
00:45:57,232 --> 00:46:00,269
then you go get you
a two-dollar ho, that's evil.

547
00:46:00,351 --> 00:46:04,424
But Brother Brown had a good time
with that two-dollar ho.

548
00:46:04,512 --> 00:46:07,868
You can push a two-dollar ho
and she don't have no limits!

549
00:46:07,952 --> 00:46:10,307
Evil and good walk hand in hand.

550
00:46:10,392 --> 00:46:14,749
- Evil is as evil does.
- l thought l'd find you here.

551
00:46:14,832 --> 00:46:18,268
- What are you doing here?
- The captain has something for us,

552
00:46:18,353 --> 00:46:21,310
info on those stiffs in the dumpster.
What's wrong?

553
00:46:21,392 --> 00:46:26,466
- Remember Nikki.
- You fucked her, didn't you?

554
00:46:26,552 --> 00:46:28,782
We got us another one!

555
00:46:31,072 --> 00:46:34,747
- Fucked who?
- You know damn well who. Nikki.

556
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:36,743
- You know damn well!
- What?

557
00:46:36,832 --> 00:46:40,507
Nikki! The whore of Babylon.
That's what she was.

558
00:46:40,593 --> 00:46:43,790
- The whore of Babylon.
- l never touched that girl.

559
00:46:43,873 --> 00:46:46,626
Then you should change
your shirts more often.

560
00:46:46,712 --> 00:46:49,944
- Her lipstick's on your collar!
- Lipstick on his collar!

561
00:46:50,033 --> 00:46:53,389
What kind of man are you?
lt's a shame and a shock!

562
00:46:53,473 --> 00:46:56,465
- lt didn't happen like that.
- Tell her.

563
00:46:56,553 --> 00:46:59,067
Don't be ashamed of yourself, boy.

564
00:46:59,153 --> 00:47:02,589
Don't be ashamed cos you went out
and got you a little ass!

565
00:47:02,673 --> 00:47:04,425
- Ass is good!
- That's right!

566
00:47:04,513 --> 00:47:08,028
l know many of y'all may be saying,
''How can he say ass is good?''

567
00:47:08,113 --> 00:47:10,708
How y'all think y'all got here?

568
00:47:10,793 --> 00:47:14,627
Ass is good!
Evil's good and ass is good.

569
00:47:14,714 --> 00:47:16,544
And if you get you
a piece of evil ass...

570
00:47:18,474 --> 00:47:20,908
Rita, where are you going?
Rita, you buggin'.

571
00:47:20,993 --> 00:47:24,350
- This is ridiculous!
- Then forget it.

572
00:47:24,433 --> 00:47:26,664
No. l left after you went to bed!

573
00:47:26,753 --> 00:47:30,429
- You don't have to explain.
- No, she bumped into me.

574
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:33,472
l was at the station.
Five guys'll swear it.

575
00:47:33,554 --> 00:47:36,227
Hey, she borrows
everything else of mine...

576
00:47:36,314 --> 00:47:39,386
Of yours?

577
00:47:40,474 --> 00:47:42,749
Did you say yours?

578
00:47:43,795 --> 00:47:46,389
- That came out wrong.
- No, you said yours.

579
00:47:46,474 --> 00:47:51,469
Forget it. You got your own rules,
you play by your own game.

580
00:47:53,115 --> 00:47:56,346
Rita, you and l, we see things
different, we know that,

581
00:47:56,435 --> 00:47:58,789
but that don't have to be
a bad thing,

582
00:47:58,875 --> 00:48:02,230
it just means we have a lot to learn
from each other.

583
00:48:03,514 --> 00:48:08,589
Now, look, l came here because
l got a line on those two John Does.

584
00:48:08,675 --> 00:48:11,951
- Guess what?
- What?

585
00:48:12,035 --> 00:48:14,151
They worked for Kitty Caprisi.

586
00:48:15,315 --> 00:48:17,465
- The mob boss?
- Bingo.

587
00:48:18,555 --> 00:48:21,707
Now, it's getting ready to rain.
Wanna get in the car?

588
00:48:35,315 --> 00:48:38,034
Heads up, y'all. Hallelujah!

589
00:48:45,036 --> 00:48:47,072
Get out of here, you piece of shit!

590
00:48:47,156 --> 00:48:50,785
- You ain't got the balls, Guido.
- You made your point, Bear.

591
00:48:50,876 --> 00:48:54,915
l could be a good stick-up man, Bear.
l'm the fucking best.

592
00:48:54,996 --> 00:48:58,705
- Here's a hot piece of ass.
- You kiss your mama with that mouth?

593
00:48:58,797 --> 00:49:01,675
l didn't know she was with somebody,
l'm sorry.

594
00:49:01,756 --> 00:49:04,828
- Sorry for the trouble.
- Get out of here, man.

595
00:49:04,916 --> 00:49:06,873
Andrew, could you do me a favour?

596
00:49:06,956 --> 00:49:10,666
- Get the fuck out of here.
- l'm going, all right?

597
00:49:10,757 --> 00:49:15,785
Bravo! You should get a Oscar
for that shit, you the man, boy.

598
00:49:15,877 --> 00:49:19,426
One minute you's you, then bam!
You're Al Sharpton!

599
00:49:19,517 --> 00:49:22,509
- Like taking candy from a child.
- Can you teach me?

600
00:49:22,597 --> 00:49:27,546
lt takes a master vampire
to transform oneself into a human,

601
00:49:27,637 --> 00:49:31,915
especially to absorb their thoughts -
you have such messy minds.

602
00:49:32,837 --> 00:49:37,992
Boss? l got an idea. Change into her
partner. That'll fuck her head up.

603
00:49:38,077 --> 00:49:40,990
There must first
be a doorway of evil.

604
00:49:41,077 --> 00:49:44,308
l've yet to discover such a thing
with this man Justice.

605
00:49:44,397 --> 00:49:46,753
Frankly, it's beginning to annoy me.

606
00:49:46,838 --> 00:49:49,398
- Me, too.
- ''Ristorante ltaliano''.

607
00:49:50,078 --> 00:49:53,035
Perfetto.
lf one is to wine and dine a woman,

608
00:49:53,118 --> 00:49:56,315
he must know
what to wine and dine her with.

609
00:49:56,398 --> 00:50:01,870
- She's in there with that cop!
- And we're all going for a ride.

610
00:50:01,958 --> 00:50:04,756
That's what l'm talking about!
Let's heat it up!

611
00:50:04,838 --> 00:50:07,591
Rip off his head
and shit down his neck, boss!

612
00:50:07,678 --> 00:50:10,556
- Act like a vampire!
- Where did you get that?

613
00:50:10,638 --> 00:50:15,029
Bloomingdale's. l broke the window
and took it off the little white man.

614
00:50:15,118 --> 00:50:17,712
l can use it more than he can. Look.

615
00:50:17,799 --> 00:50:19,835
You're improvising. Very good.

616
00:50:19,918 --> 00:50:22,672
You're turning into
my best ghoul ever.

617
00:50:22,758 --> 00:50:25,318
Get your fuckin' hands up, Sambo!
Move it!

618
00:50:25,398 --> 00:50:28,311
- Move your ass!
- Take my hand, it's all l got.

619
00:50:28,399 --> 00:50:32,108
Shove it up your ass, Meadowlark.
What are you, a magician?

620
00:50:32,199 --> 00:50:36,112
- Give me your fucking wallet.
- Brooklyn...

621
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:39,032
- Come on!
- ..l love this place.

622
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:41,792
Jesus Christ. Oh, you fucking...!

623
00:50:41,879 --> 00:50:43,915
- Holy shit!
- Dumbass.

624
00:50:45,439 --> 00:50:50,559
They was making a pick-up on, let's
just say some business proceeds.

625
00:50:50,639 --> 00:50:53,393
- A pick-up from who?
- A punk numbers runner,

626
00:50:53,479 --> 00:50:56,198
name of Julius something or other.

627
00:50:56,279 --> 00:50:59,749
l seen his girlfriend kick
the living snot out of him once.

628
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:02,797
lt's some big broad named Eva.
Lives on Court.

629
00:51:02,879 --> 00:51:06,714
So you think this Julius
could've iced your boys?

630
00:51:06,799 --> 00:51:09,314
- lced our boys?
- That putz couldn't ice tea!

631
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:12,197
He's almost as big a chickenshit
as Guido.

632
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:18,077
Drop your shit on the floor.
Nobody be smart.

633
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:22,438
Put your fuckin' guns on the floor!
Come on, let's go! And you!

634
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:25,910
Empty the cash register right now!
Hurry up, do it!

635
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,115
OK, here we go.

636
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:30,272
Hey, there's a lot of fuckin' love
in this room.

637
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:33,511
Speaking of which, do you believe in
love at first sight?

638
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:36,433
- Get the hell away from me.
- Playing hard to get?

639
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:40,308
Lemme work on you. Watch it, Shaft,
l'll put a hole in your afro.

640
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:45,030
You're gonna be my new girlfriend.
Here we go. ls that register empty?

641
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:48,351
What's with this shit?
Get rid of this fuckin' garlic.

642
00:51:48,441 --> 00:51:51,750
Garlic bread, signore?

643
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:56,232
The next person to offer a garlic
product is gonna get one in the ass.

644
00:51:57,201 --> 00:52:00,989
Tell that fuckin' cat to
shut the fuck up or l'll whack him!

645
00:52:01,081 --> 00:52:02,480
Easy, Sugar.

646
00:52:02,561 --> 00:52:06,600
l'm starvin'. You want take-out?
What's your favourite pasta?

647
00:52:06,681 --> 00:52:09,593
- Fusilli.
- Mine, too. We need pasta here!

648
00:52:09,681 --> 00:52:12,957
Garlic boy, get us some fusilli,
two to go.

649
00:52:13,041 --> 00:52:15,680
- Move your ass!
- lt's coming.

650
00:52:15,761 --> 00:52:19,436
Fuckin' music is making my ears
bleed. We need wine, too, honey.

651
00:52:19,521 --> 00:52:22,115
- Red.
- Joey, red wine. Move your ass.

652
00:52:22,202 --> 00:52:24,271
This place is making me itch.

653
00:52:26,602 --> 00:52:28,910
Sugar!

654
00:52:29,001 --> 00:52:32,551
The fuckin' cat had it coming,
hissing and making claws...

655
00:52:37,882 --> 00:52:40,635
- Mama mia!
- Son of a bitch, l'll kill him!

656
00:52:40,722 --> 00:52:44,397
- l like cats.
- You should have said so, dollface.

657
00:52:46,442 --> 00:52:47,921
Not so tight, Mr Tibbs.

658
00:52:48,002 --> 00:52:52,678
- Hey, lover, you're coming with me.
- l'm going with her, OK? Let's go.

659
00:52:52,762 --> 00:52:56,232
- Bear, who's got the balls now, huh?
- Fuck you!

660
00:53:04,482 --> 00:53:07,953
- You always gotta be the hero.
- lt was an impulse, OK?

661
00:53:08,042 --> 00:53:11,240
This guy had a .38 to your head,
he could've killed you.

662
00:53:11,323 --> 00:53:13,996
- lt was a .45. l resent that.
- Shut up.

663
00:53:14,082 --> 00:53:18,554
Hey, l know you. Didn't l see you at
Jugs on 5th Street, that titty bar?

664
00:53:18,642 --> 00:53:21,441
- Shut up!
- Look, l brought him down.

665
00:53:21,522 --> 00:53:24,595
- Why can't you give me that?
- Because he's an asshole!

666
00:53:24,682 --> 00:53:27,243
- Shut up!
- You were out of line

667
00:53:27,323 --> 00:53:30,281
and you know damn well
you should've waited for me.

668
00:53:30,363 --> 00:53:33,355
She don't need you, Soul Train.
Tell him.

669
00:53:33,443 --> 00:53:38,233
Shut up! Look, l was at the right
place at the right time, no big deal!

670
00:53:38,323 --> 00:53:42,032
The city of Brooklyn shall be judged
as the city of Babylon!

671
00:53:42,124 --> 00:53:47,356
lt says here, ''She bears a golden cup
filled with her abominations

672
00:53:47,443 --> 00:53:49,753
''and the filth of her fornications.''

673
00:53:51,044 --> 00:53:54,161
We are supposed to be partners,
look out for one another,

674
00:53:54,244 --> 00:53:58,442
- but you just don't get it, do you?
- Get what?

675
00:53:59,164 --> 00:54:04,477
l care about you
a little more than l'm supposed to

676
00:54:04,564 --> 00:54:06,395
but l can't help that.

677
00:54:12,044 --> 00:54:14,842
Nikki! That's where l know you from!

678
00:54:14,924 --> 00:54:19,156
Nikki from Bed-Stuy told me some cop
named Justice beast-fucked her.

679
00:54:19,244 --> 00:54:22,635
- You're the beast that fucked Nikki!
- Shut the fuck up!

680
00:54:22,725 --> 00:54:26,115
lt was you. You beast-fucked her.
You know you did it.

681
00:54:26,204 --> 00:54:28,321
l don't know what he's talking about.

682
00:54:32,244 --> 00:54:37,602
- Veder, in my office right now.
- You did good. He's an asshole.

683
00:54:37,685 --> 00:54:40,596
He deserved every piece of palm
that hit him.

684
00:54:40,685 --> 00:54:43,074
Hey, take it easy.
What's the matter with you?

685
00:54:43,165 --> 00:54:47,204
- Hey, police brutality!
- Do something with this fucker!

686
00:54:47,285 --> 00:54:50,038
Soul Train,
me and you right now, huh?

687
00:54:50,125 --> 00:54:52,275
You been informed of your rights?

688
00:54:52,365 --> 00:54:54,754
- Two days' suspension!
- What? Two days?

689
00:54:54,845 --> 00:54:58,474
Yes, l've been informed
of everything that l need to know.

690
00:54:58,565 --> 00:55:00,999
Another nutcase. All right, move it.

691
00:55:04,846 --> 00:55:06,563
Try and kill the cop.

692
00:55:08,966 --> 00:55:11,559
Sinner! Sinner!

693
00:55:15,846 --> 00:55:17,996
What is wrong with...?

694
00:55:18,566 --> 00:55:20,796
He went that way.

695
00:55:21,886 --> 00:55:24,320
Why don't you guys do a job, huh?

696
00:55:24,405 --> 00:55:26,601
What are we doing on the floor?

697
00:55:55,687 --> 00:55:57,598
Watch it!

698
00:55:59,287 --> 00:56:02,802
- ldiot!
- Watch where you're going, lady!

699
00:56:05,087 --> 00:56:06,805
Yeah, thanks.

700
00:56:06,887 --> 00:56:10,004
Aw, jeez. Sunday drivers.

701
00:56:12,567 --> 00:56:16,083
- Hey, you're...
- Mr Popular.

702
00:56:16,167 --> 00:56:18,044
But my friends call me Max.

703
00:56:19,127 --> 00:56:22,039
- Well, l'm...
- Rita. l remember.

704
00:56:22,127 --> 00:56:25,085
l was just going by
and you needed help.

705
00:56:25,168 --> 00:56:26,839
You're bleeding.

706
00:56:38,047 --> 00:56:42,166
You know, that's twice l owe you.
You always gotta be the hero?

707
00:56:42,248 --> 00:56:45,479
l just happened to be in
the right place at the right time,

708
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:48,128
it's really no big deal.

709
00:56:50,248 --> 00:56:52,284
Look, the bar thing...

710
00:56:52,368 --> 00:56:54,757
- Oh, that was my fault.
- No.

711
00:56:54,848 --> 00:56:57,601
l apologise.
My friend was drunk that night.

712
00:56:57,689 --> 00:57:01,397
lt was, really, it was
one of those days, you know?

713
00:57:01,488 --> 00:57:03,160
Kinda like today.

714
00:57:03,248 --> 00:57:06,320
l understand.
l'm more of a night person myself.

715
00:57:07,488 --> 00:57:10,878
Really? So am l.

716
00:57:17,889 --> 00:57:22,041
l'd better get going.
l'm starving, too.

717
00:57:25,969 --> 00:57:30,042
- Thanks. Good night.
- Good night.

718
00:57:33,369 --> 00:57:35,837
Do you like ltalian?

719
00:57:38,649 --> 00:57:41,721
l make an excellent fusilli.

720
00:57:43,529 --> 00:57:45,679
Actually, that's my favourite

721
00:57:45,769 --> 00:57:49,887
but l really think l ought
to take a raincheck.

722
00:57:49,970 --> 00:57:52,278
Oh. There's someone else.

723
00:57:59,530 --> 00:58:01,360
Not any more.

724
00:58:01,450 --> 00:58:06,922
lf there's no one else, then
l would love to have you for dinner.

725
00:58:17,570 --> 00:58:20,243
Look here. l'm a cop.

726
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:23,640
- The police.
- The law.

727
00:58:23,730 --> 00:58:28,122
Which means if you try
anything funny, l'll shoot you.

728
00:58:29,451 --> 00:58:32,727
Do l look like l would bite you?

729
00:58:32,810 --> 00:58:35,848
You better not.
Not after the day l've had.

730
00:58:35,931 --> 00:58:39,082
Can l send my car to pick you up
in a half hour?

731
00:58:40,971 --> 00:58:45,999
Your car.
Well, then, let's make it an hour.

732
00:58:46,091 --> 00:58:48,480
l'll see you then.

733
00:59:19,652 --> 00:59:23,804
Look, Rita,
l got a few things l need to say

734
00:59:23,892 --> 00:59:26,611
cos this is
real hard for me and... Shit.

735
00:59:26,692 --> 00:59:31,243
l never said nothing
like this before and l... Damn.

736
00:59:31,332 --> 00:59:32,891
Look, l'm the man

737
00:59:32,972 --> 00:59:35,964
and l got a few things
l gotta set your ass straight on.

738
00:59:36,052 --> 00:59:38,008
You're gonna do what l say do!

739
00:59:40,213 --> 00:59:42,282
l must be crazy...

740
00:59:49,933 --> 00:59:52,128
So what are you doing here?

741
00:59:52,212 --> 00:59:54,408
l was just...

742
00:59:55,492 --> 00:59:58,644
- Where are you going?
- Dinner.

743
00:59:58,733 --> 01:00:00,849
Dinner? Dressed like that?

744
01:00:04,453 --> 01:00:07,047
- Who you going with?
- A friend.

745
01:00:07,653 --> 01:00:12,408
A girlfriend? l'm just saying,
cos damn, you look good.

746
01:00:12,493 --> 01:00:15,087
Can l give you a ride or something?

747
01:00:16,293 --> 01:00:19,490
- l've got one, thanks.
- Damn, that's your ride?

748
01:00:22,574 --> 01:00:25,929
- Miss Rita, good evening.
- Good evening.

749
01:00:29,213 --> 01:00:30,932
Gotta go.

750
01:00:31,013 --> 01:00:33,812
Oh, did you want something?

751
01:00:33,893 --> 01:00:38,445
l... l was just gonna get
a pizza and you know, l thought...

752
01:00:39,533 --> 01:00:43,925
- Just have a good time, that's all.
- Thanks.

753
01:00:44,014 --> 01:00:48,007
- Enjoy your dinner.
- Yeah. You, too.

754
01:00:53,094 --> 01:00:56,291
You thought you was gonna
get some ass tonight.

755
01:00:56,374 --> 01:00:59,924
Take your ass to Blockbuster,
get a video.

756
01:01:00,015 --> 01:01:02,164
Pizza place.

757
01:01:02,254 --> 01:01:05,804
Ain't no pizza place around here,
you lyin' motherfucker.

758
01:01:07,575 --> 01:01:11,123
See ya. Need to lighten up,
stand there lookin' all mean.

759
01:01:11,214 --> 01:01:13,854
Get your lyin' ass out of the street!

760
01:01:17,575 --> 01:01:21,090
- Are you sure this is it?
- Yeah, that's it.

761
01:01:21,175 --> 01:01:23,211
Right down that hall to the right.

762
01:01:24,335 --> 01:01:28,453
A minute earlier, she'd have
caught me casting every spell l knew

763
01:01:28,535 --> 01:01:30,571
on Julius's pigsty of an apartment

764
01:01:30,655 --> 01:01:34,614
but by the time she arrived
l had the place in reasonable shape,

765
01:01:34,696 --> 01:01:36,651
if l do say so myself.

766
01:01:49,536 --> 01:01:52,573
Please excuse my building,
l just acquired it.

767
01:01:52,656 --> 01:01:56,285
- This is incredible.
- No, you are. You look fabulous.

768
01:01:56,376 --> 01:01:59,095
Thank you. l don't get to dress up
too often.

769
01:01:59,176 --> 01:02:01,451
That should change.
You like red wine?

770
01:02:01,536 --> 01:02:07,294
- Yes. lt's the only one l drink.
- Really? We share similar taste.

771
01:02:10,296 --> 01:02:13,094
Van Gogh.
He's my favourite painter.

772
01:02:13,816 --> 01:02:15,772
Have a closer look.

773
01:02:18,177 --> 01:02:20,896
ls that the original?

774
01:02:20,976 --> 01:02:23,445
Yes. He's my favourite, as well,

775
01:02:23,537 --> 01:02:27,575
so torn by visions that no one
around him could appreciate.

776
01:02:27,657 --> 01:02:32,128
l'm strangely drawn to his art.
lt's sort of an outlet for me.

777
01:02:33,577 --> 01:02:35,647
l know what you mean.

778
01:02:36,697 --> 01:02:39,973
- lt's beautiful.
- Yes, it is.

779
01:02:42,257 --> 01:02:46,375
To the beauty...of the night.

780
01:02:51,857 --> 01:02:54,610
Right here, l got it for you.

781
01:02:54,697 --> 01:02:57,131
- Go away!
- Police officer.

782
01:02:57,217 --> 01:03:00,129
Just wanna ask you
a few questions, ma'am.

783
01:03:00,938 --> 01:03:04,009
What are you trying to do,
break my door down?

784
01:03:04,098 --> 01:03:06,816
Show me your shield,
not like it'll mean shit.

785
01:03:06,898 --> 01:03:10,048
Just wanna ask about a friend,
goofy-looking guy,

786
01:03:10,138 --> 01:03:15,292
- numbers runner for Kitty Caprisi.
- Julius? He in trouble? Come on in.

787
01:03:16,178 --> 01:03:18,134
l feel as if you know me.

788
01:03:18,218 --> 01:03:20,812
We do have a lot in common, don't we?

789
01:03:20,898 --> 01:03:25,608
Some things, yes,
but you've been to so many places,

790
01:03:25,698 --> 01:03:29,976
you've seen so much,
you've had such an exciting life.

791
01:03:30,058 --> 01:03:33,095
You might say that l've had several.

792
01:03:36,818 --> 01:03:42,814
Sometimes l wonder what's out there,
beyond the skyline, beyond Brooklyn,

793
01:03:42,899 --> 01:03:45,254
past everything l've ever known.

794
01:03:45,338 --> 01:03:51,095
- There's no place you can't go.
- No place the subway doesn't run.

795
01:03:51,179 --> 01:03:55,297
But what about your dreams, Rita?
Your dreams of another life?

796
01:03:55,379 --> 01:03:57,973
And another world? Another you?

797
01:04:00,059 --> 01:04:02,050
Everyone has those dreams.

798
01:04:04,019 --> 01:04:09,173
You've a hunger never satisfied
and a need never fulfilled.

799
01:04:12,619 --> 01:04:14,849
God only knows what l need.

800
01:04:15,980 --> 01:04:19,528
And l know.
You need to give me this drink...

801
01:04:19,619 --> 01:04:21,371
and give me your hand...

802
01:04:21,460 --> 01:04:24,133
- and come dance with me.
- Oh, no.

803
01:04:24,220 --> 01:04:27,690
- l'm not a good dancer.
- Come, please. Just one dance.

804
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:29,451
Come, come.

805
01:04:29,540 --> 01:04:33,897
Oh, Max. This is crazy.

806
01:04:35,340 --> 01:04:38,776
There's nothing wrong with being
just a little crazy.

807
01:05:01,180 --> 01:05:04,491
l've never danced like this before.

808
01:05:04,580 --> 01:05:06,969
And now, you'll never stop.

809
01:05:17,421 --> 01:05:22,256
l haven't felt like this since...
l've never felt like this.

810
01:05:22,341 --> 01:05:25,174
How would you like to feel like this
every night?

811
01:05:25,261 --> 01:05:27,332
ls that a trick question?

812
01:05:30,142 --> 01:05:32,336
To go to places you've never been?

813
01:05:34,021 --> 01:05:37,378
- Yes.
- Drink the wine you've never tasted?

814
01:05:41,382 --> 01:05:44,374
l can give it to you, Rita.

815
01:05:44,462 --> 01:05:48,216
A world where no one laughs at you
for what you feel,

816
01:05:48,302 --> 01:05:50,770
what you see, what you are.

817
01:05:54,542 --> 01:05:56,772
All you have to do is just...

818
01:05:58,622 --> 01:06:00,419
say...

819
01:06:05,102 --> 01:06:07,172
say the word, say it.

820
01:06:44,183 --> 01:06:49,735
- Looking for the girl?
- The girl? What girl?

821
01:06:49,824 --> 01:06:53,259
You're a cop,
you're supposed to remember faces.

822
01:06:54,983 --> 01:06:57,213
The night watchman down at the dock?

823
01:06:57,303 --> 01:07:01,091
Right. l'm also the proud landlord
of this residential type place,

824
01:07:01,183 --> 01:07:04,414
so l do know who comes
and l do know who goes.

825
01:07:04,504 --> 01:07:07,813
l'm looking for a brother
named Julius. Julius Jones.

826
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:11,816
Jones, Jones...
l knew a Latoya Jones once.

827
01:07:11,904 --> 01:07:15,419
Called her Mrs Butterworth cos
she had a ass flat like a pancake.

828
01:07:15,504 --> 01:07:19,258
l haven't seen her around lately
but l have seen your partner,

829
01:07:19,344 --> 01:07:20,743
yes l have.

830
01:07:22,504 --> 01:07:24,142
You seen my partner?

831
01:07:24,224 --> 01:07:28,820
Musta done some serious bumpin'
last night with that cat.

832
01:07:28,905 --> 01:07:31,976
- What cat?
- Some suave motherfucker.

833
01:07:32,065 --> 01:07:36,581
New tenant. He's been
tapping that top-shelf booty!

834
01:07:36,664 --> 01:07:38,541
l'm talking bang-bang-bang!

835
01:07:38,624 --> 01:07:42,857
When she walked out this morning,
she was bow-legged.

836
01:07:42,945 --> 01:07:47,894
- So you know where she went?
- l'd say she went home to sleep.

837
01:07:47,985 --> 01:07:51,340
Course, she didn't get none
last night. Bang-bang...

838
01:07:51,425 --> 01:07:53,380
1 3 Fox, come in, over.

839
01:07:54,664 --> 01:07:57,737
- Shit.
- Justice, where are you?

840
01:08:00,985 --> 01:08:05,137
- 1 3 Fox, what's up?
- A DOA at Brooklyn City Hall.

841
01:08:05,225 --> 01:08:09,013
Female, late twenties,
Captain requests you on the site.

842
01:08:14,866 --> 01:08:17,585
- Hey, Connie.
- Hey.

843
01:08:17,665 --> 01:08:20,737
God knows who or what
got her up there.

844
01:08:20,825 --> 01:08:22,942
Let me see that thing.

845
01:08:26,786 --> 01:08:31,336
Looks like a bed sheet
or something she's wrapped up in.

846
01:08:31,426 --> 01:08:32,939
Shit!

847
01:08:37,026 --> 01:08:39,062
Damn. Nikki.

848
01:08:41,786 --> 01:08:45,335
lf there's one thing
a vampire has, it is patience,

849
01:08:45,426 --> 01:08:48,099
especially with those
of his own kind.

850
01:08:48,906 --> 01:08:53,582
But even that, in time, runs out
and then in the family of darkness,

851
01:08:53,667 --> 01:08:57,375
blood will prove thicker
than water can ever be.

852
01:09:11,427 --> 01:09:14,816
Rita, wake up! Rita, wake up!

853
01:09:18,947 --> 01:09:24,260
Damn, girl! l musta called here
50 times! Did you sleep all day?

854
01:09:24,347 --> 01:09:29,501
l'm thirsty. What's going on?
What are you doing here?

855
01:09:31,108 --> 01:09:32,587
lt's about Nikki.

856
01:09:35,468 --> 01:09:39,541
- Whatever happened between you...
- She's dead, Rita.

857
01:09:42,987 --> 01:09:46,378
- What?
- But it's more than that.

858
01:09:48,828 --> 01:09:53,504
The way she was hanging
was exactly the way you painted it.

859
01:09:57,548 --> 01:10:02,338
- No, it was just a dream.
- No, it's real.

860
01:10:03,548 --> 01:10:08,303
Everything that you believed in
and l didn't is real.

861
01:10:08,389 --> 01:10:10,425
Justice, you saw her?

862
01:10:20,229 --> 01:10:24,506
- Then somehow l'm not crazy.
- No.

863
01:10:24,589 --> 01:10:27,023
No crazier than the rest of us.

864
01:10:28,589 --> 01:10:31,899
Why me? Why is this happening to me?

865
01:10:31,989 --> 01:10:34,548
l don't know...

866
01:10:34,629 --> 01:10:37,587
but we'll figure this out, together.

867
01:10:40,149 --> 01:10:44,062
Now, we make mistakes
and we have differences but...

868
01:10:47,109 --> 01:10:51,466
that's OK,
we're only human, right?

869
01:11:22,030 --> 01:11:24,828
- You know what you're doin'?
- No.

870
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:30,145
l'll make it up as l go.

871
01:11:44,431 --> 01:11:46,386
l want this but...

872
01:11:47,991 --> 01:11:50,505
Damn! Oh, damn!

873
01:12:56,513 --> 01:12:57,740
ldiot!

874
01:13:06,833 --> 01:13:10,587
Easy. Honey lamb, now ain't
a good time to fuck with the man...

875
01:13:13,753 --> 01:13:16,551
- Oh, shit, he got you too?
- l'll handle this.

876
01:13:16,633 --> 01:13:18,624
l'll be in the kitchen.

877
01:13:18,713 --> 01:13:20,988
- Want a cappuccino?
- Welcome home.

878
01:13:21,073 --> 01:13:22,472
Do you still take red?

879
01:13:22,553 --> 01:13:26,831
After last night, you'll want
something with a little more bite.

880
01:13:26,913 --> 01:13:29,825
- What have you done to me?
- Only what you asked.

881
01:13:29,913 --> 01:13:33,542
- l didn't ask for this!
- No, but you wanted it.

882
01:13:33,633 --> 01:13:36,831
You needed it and now
you can feel it, look at you.

883
01:13:36,913 --> 01:13:40,623
You feel more alive than you've
ever been, stop fighting it.

884
01:13:40,714 --> 01:13:43,864
- Death becomes you.
- lt was you, wasn't it?

885
01:13:43,954 --> 01:13:48,789
All the murders,
the alley, the boat, Nikki.

886
01:13:48,873 --> 01:13:53,709
lt's a gift but you have it too,
l just unwrapped it for you.

887
01:13:53,794 --> 01:13:58,788
- Gift?! Of what, death?
- Of life!

888
01:13:58,874 --> 01:14:03,550
- l have given you eternal life!
- This isn't happening.

889
01:14:03,634 --> 01:14:06,387
lt's happening as we speak.
Can you feel it?

890
01:14:06,474 --> 01:14:09,625
Come here! Listen. Listen to me!

891
01:14:09,714 --> 01:14:13,832
Do you hear that? Do you hear it?
That is the sound of the night

892
01:14:13,914 --> 01:14:15,985
and it's calling.

893
01:14:16,075 --> 01:14:18,542
Not to me. Not to me!

894
01:14:26,555 --> 01:14:28,466
Women.

895
01:14:37,235 --> 01:14:40,705
Frightening, isn't it?

896
01:14:41,355 --> 01:14:43,585
Yes, you are.

897
01:14:45,275 --> 01:14:47,551
l meant freedom

898
01:14:47,635 --> 01:14:51,310
to do anything you want,
any time, anywhere.

899
01:14:51,395 --> 01:14:54,149
l know it's terrifying at first.

900
01:14:54,235 --> 01:14:57,466
l passed terrified
about half an hour ago.

901
01:15:00,155 --> 01:15:04,671
All your life you wondered why you
felt things that no one else felt,

902
01:15:04,756 --> 01:15:08,192
why you never caught a cold,
never broke a bone.

903
01:15:09,956 --> 01:15:13,471
This is just a dream, right?
Soon l'm gonna wake up and...

904
01:15:13,556 --> 01:15:15,353
And l will be there.

905
01:15:19,956 --> 01:15:24,632
l'm not going to be alone again.
l'd perish without you.

906
01:15:26,236 --> 01:15:31,913
l gotta go back, go back to my life,

907
01:15:31,996 --> 01:15:35,876
you can't stop me.
You can't.

908
01:15:36,957 --> 01:15:40,836
Then go. Go back to
your little shoe-box apartment

909
01:15:40,916 --> 01:15:42,952
filled with those empty dreams.

910
01:15:43,037 --> 01:15:45,676
Go back to church
and don't forget the collection,

911
01:15:45,757 --> 01:15:48,224
the preacher's whisky is running low.

912
01:15:48,316 --> 01:15:51,673
Go back to your job!
Where they laugh and call you crazy!

913
01:15:51,756 --> 01:15:55,113
Or you face the truth -

914
01:15:56,197 --> 01:15:59,554
that you have
no place left to go but to me.

915
01:16:01,237 --> 01:16:06,709
What do you know about truth?
You lied to me from the beginning.

916
01:16:08,437 --> 01:16:11,156
- Your father sent me to you.
- What?

917
01:16:11,238 --> 01:16:14,388
That's the truth. Your father.

918
01:16:15,477 --> 01:16:18,150
lf l had told you that
when l first met you,

919
01:16:18,238 --> 01:16:20,512
if l had told you what you were,

920
01:16:20,598 --> 01:16:22,475
would you believe me

921
01:16:22,558 --> 01:16:25,947
if l told you that you were
the daughter of a vampire?

922
01:16:28,917 --> 01:16:33,355
- You're lying!
- You'd have loved your father.

923
01:16:33,437 --> 01:16:35,793
Your mother did
before they killed him.

924
01:16:35,878 --> 01:16:38,312
Who? Who killed him? Who?

925
01:16:40,638 --> 01:16:45,348
Humans! Humans fear what they don't
understand and hate what they fear.

926
01:16:45,438 --> 01:16:50,956
He sacrificed himself so your mother
could live. lt drove her insane.

927
01:16:53,239 --> 01:16:56,230
But what if l don't want this?

928
01:17:03,038 --> 01:17:05,348
What if you do?

929
01:17:17,399 --> 01:17:19,469
What if you do?

930
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:51,229
Who's there?

931
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:56,509
Step into the light.

932
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:04,115
- Detective Justice.
- You were expecting me?

933
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:07,718
You or the dark one,
could have gone either way.

934
01:18:07,801 --> 01:18:11,680
- Personally, l'm glad it's you.
- l need your help.

935
01:18:13,721 --> 01:18:17,350
- Things have changed. Sit down.
- Rita has changed.

936
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:23,720
She's seeing things in her dreams.

937
01:18:25,161 --> 01:18:27,914
- Now she's missing.
- What kind of dreams?

938
01:18:28,561 --> 01:18:30,916
Nightmares. She paints them.

939
01:18:31,001 --> 01:18:35,472
A girl was murdered and it was
exactly the way Rita painted it.

940
01:18:35,561 --> 01:18:38,519
And then...then l saw this.

941
01:18:40,361 --> 01:18:43,239
This is the last one she did.

942
01:18:43,322 --> 01:18:46,233
Then it's true there was a child.

943
01:18:46,321 --> 01:18:50,394
l knew Rita's mother.
l was in love with her years ago.

944
01:18:50,482 --> 01:18:54,555
She studied the vampires
of my island. l was her guide.

945
01:18:56,161 --> 01:19:00,120
l saw her succumb to the powers
of the dark one and Rita

946
01:19:00,202 --> 01:19:01,954
is the result.

947
01:19:03,682 --> 01:19:07,391
lt's like, just clean my house,
l don't care if your kid's sick...

948
01:19:07,482 --> 01:19:10,918
- Please don't.
- We must. Besides, she deserves it.

949
01:19:12,122 --> 01:19:15,114
We must feed, Rita, or we die.

950
01:19:16,122 --> 01:19:20,081
- Well, here's my shortcut.
- Bye-bye.

951
01:19:22,362 --> 01:19:24,557
This one is the last.

952
01:19:25,322 --> 01:19:28,359
He needs her.
He has to move very, very quickly.

953
01:19:28,443 --> 01:19:31,161
- l'll kill him if he hurts her.
- You have to.

954
01:19:31,242 --> 01:19:35,713
To save her, you must kill him before
she abandons her humanity and feeds.

955
01:19:35,802 --> 01:19:40,433
Much as she is human,
she is now also a predator.

956
01:19:53,443 --> 01:19:57,641
What's a nice girl like you
doing in a place like this?

957
01:19:57,723 --> 01:19:59,918
l have pepper spray and l'll use it!

958
01:20:00,963 --> 01:20:03,841
But l want you to know
l understand the Negro people.

959
01:20:03,923 --> 01:20:08,394
You've been chained by the oppression
of white capitalist society.

960
01:20:08,484 --> 01:20:12,318
Yes, well...
then you'll understand this!

961
01:20:31,444 --> 01:20:37,041
Your turn, Rita. Taste her.
Taste her and quench the hunger.

962
01:20:39,164 --> 01:20:41,553
- l won't do it!
- You don't have a choice!

963
01:20:41,644 --> 01:20:44,284
No deposit, no return, no going back.

964
01:20:49,324 --> 01:20:51,360
Help me.

965
01:20:53,485 --> 01:20:55,760
l'm not going forward!

966
01:20:55,845 --> 01:21:01,636
You can't run from your hunger!
There's no place you can hide!

967
01:21:26,405 --> 01:21:28,077
Forgive us our trespasses

968
01:21:28,166 --> 01:21:30,918
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

969
01:21:31,005 --> 01:21:35,521
And lead us not into temptation
but deliver us from evil!

970
01:21:35,606 --> 01:21:37,561
Help me!

971
01:21:47,526 --> 01:21:50,437
- Where are you taking me?
- You need rest.

972
01:21:50,526 --> 01:21:52,356
We have a long journey ahead.

973
01:21:52,446 --> 01:21:56,519
- Where we going, boss?
- Home! While she rests, you pack.

974
01:21:56,606 --> 01:21:58,801
We try to leave by dawn.

975
01:21:58,886 --> 01:22:01,605
- Can l talk to you about my head?
- Drive!

976
01:22:15,327 --> 01:22:16,645
Ready my coffin.

977
01:22:16,727 --> 01:22:19,764
She don't look ready, she need a nap.

978
01:22:19,846 --> 01:22:23,635
l'm readyin' the coffin
cos we gettin' the fuck out of here.

979
01:22:23,727 --> 01:22:26,525
Rita...my sweet.

980
01:22:26,607 --> 01:22:31,362
- You must feed or you'll die.
- l want to die.

981
01:22:32,927 --> 01:22:36,124
l won't let you.
l'll find someone for you.

982
01:22:36,207 --> 01:22:41,520
Hey, hey, the Knicks won!
Julius, goddammit, you owe me $50!

983
01:22:41,887 --> 01:22:44,447
Good God, he's a bad motherfucker.

984
01:22:44,527 --> 01:22:47,520
Julius, where's my $50?

985
01:22:49,567 --> 01:22:52,765
You ain't Julius.
You that cop's girl.

986
01:22:52,847 --> 01:22:57,683
What's wrong, baby? You look sick.
Had too much pork, huh? Bad pig meat.

987
01:22:57,768 --> 01:23:00,885
Want some cod liver oil?
Tell me what you need.

988
01:23:00,967 --> 01:23:03,243
What she needs...

989
01:23:03,328 --> 01:23:06,161
- is some fresh blood.
- Blood?

990
01:23:06,248 --> 01:23:09,126
l'll go to the Red Cross,

991
01:23:09,207 --> 01:23:13,838
- Shut up!
- Hey, brother, what's the idea?

992
01:23:13,928 --> 01:23:18,285
- The idea is dinner.
- Dinner? What we havin'?

993
01:23:18,368 --> 01:23:21,166
- You.
- Me? Don't do it, baby.

994
01:23:21,248 --> 01:23:25,799
- You don't have to resist. Do it!
- Don't! l got high blood pressure!

995
01:23:25,888 --> 01:23:28,449
High as the motherfuckin' moon!

996
01:23:30,408 --> 01:23:33,241
- Police! Police!
- lt's OK.

997
01:23:35,329 --> 01:23:38,605
- Police!
- Rita, it's over. Just walk away.

998
01:23:38,688 --> 01:23:42,921
- Hey, coffin's all ready, B.
- Take care of that one.

999
01:23:43,009 --> 01:23:47,560

1000
01:23:47,649 --> 01:23:50,288
or l'm gonna put this shit
all over you.

1001
01:23:53,049 --> 01:23:56,644
- You better shut up.
- Oh, you're not afraid.

1002
01:24:01,329 --> 01:24:03,604
That's my fuckin' eye!

1003
01:24:03,690 --> 01:24:05,759
Come back here. Shit.

1004
01:24:07,409 --> 01:24:10,845
You're quite a bulldog
but Rita belongs to me now.

1005
01:24:10,929 --> 01:24:12,362
Motherfuck you, man.

1006
01:24:13,929 --> 01:24:15,362
Shit.

1007
01:24:26,409 --> 01:24:29,766
The heart. This is my stomach.

1008
01:24:29,849 --> 01:24:32,922
This is my heart, this is my stomach.

1009
01:24:33,010 --> 01:24:35,729
You should know the rules, Zeko.

1010
01:24:40,730 --> 01:24:42,562
Not him.

1011
01:25:01,011 --> 01:25:02,364
Are you OK?

1012
01:25:02,730 --> 01:25:05,291
My leg! l think he broke my leg!

1013
01:25:05,371 --> 01:25:08,920
Fuck your leg, have you seen my eye?
Easy, B, l need my eye!

1014
01:25:09,011 --> 01:25:11,081
- Your eye?
- Came out of my head.

1015
01:25:12,131 --> 01:25:16,602
Oh, damn! Watch yo' step, nigger!
You done mashed my shit all up!

1016
01:25:17,571 --> 01:25:20,927
- Coast clear?
- Yeah. Come on, give us a hand.

1017
01:25:21,012 --> 01:25:22,729
l gotta find a eye doctor.

1018
01:25:22,812 --> 01:25:26,963
l want y'all to get outta here
and get him to a hospital.

1019
01:25:27,052 --> 01:25:30,600
- l'm not leaving without Rita.
- Remember the painting.

1020
01:25:30,691 --> 01:25:33,889
lf she joins with him,
she'll strike you next.

1021
01:25:33,971 --> 01:25:38,841
Let her go. Bitch tried to suck me
like l'm a 40-ounce of malt liquor!

1022
01:25:40,972 --> 01:25:44,203
- Kill him.
- Thanks, Doc.

1023
01:25:44,291 --> 01:25:46,487
God is with you.

1024
01:25:46,572 --> 01:25:49,530
- l'll keep that in mind.
- You gonna need Him.

1025
01:25:49,612 --> 01:25:52,570
Come on.
We'll get you outta here too.

1026
01:25:52,652 --> 01:25:55,724
l ain't going.
My homey's taking care of me.

1027
01:25:55,812 --> 01:26:00,203
Have you seen yourself lately?
Let's get the hell out of here.

1028
01:26:00,292 --> 01:26:03,011
- Don't rip my shirt.
- Now, look at this shit!

1029
01:26:03,092 --> 01:26:04,969
That my arm!

1030
01:26:05,053 --> 01:26:08,203
- You put that back on!
- Now you're The Fugitive.

1031
01:26:08,292 --> 01:26:10,249
You put that back on!

1032
01:26:10,332 --> 01:26:13,449
l need this! You can't just snatch
a brother's arm.

1033
01:26:38,494 --> 01:26:40,530
Right through your black heart!

1034
01:26:42,733 --> 01:26:44,803
You shouldn't have come.

1035
01:26:46,614 --> 01:26:49,252
lt's too late for me.

1036
01:26:54,373 --> 01:26:56,569
Rita, we... Oh, shit! Look at you!

1037
01:26:56,654 --> 01:27:02,490
- Now it's too late for you.
- Still don't believe in vampires?

1038
01:27:02,574 --> 01:27:05,247
l'm taking Rita.
lt's not too late for her.

1039
01:27:05,334 --> 01:27:08,167
You should be worried about yourself.

1040
01:27:10,014 --> 01:27:13,165
- Hey, bitch.
- Rita, get away from him!

1041
01:27:15,574 --> 01:27:18,487
l can give her everything!
Why deny her that?

1042
01:27:18,574 --> 01:27:21,532
She doesn't belong with you!
She's not a killer!

1043
01:27:21,614 --> 01:27:25,971
- lt's in her blood!
- But not in her heart!

1044
01:27:26,054 --> 01:27:29,012
- Are you sure?
- l'm sure you're ugly.

1045
01:27:34,575 --> 01:27:36,246
Come, you bastard.

1046
01:27:50,614 --> 01:27:54,291
That's it! Goddammit! ldiot!

1047
01:27:56,695 --> 01:28:00,244
Get the fuck away from the knife.
Get... Come here!

1048
01:28:00,335 --> 01:28:05,012
Not in her heart, you say?
Why don't you ask her what she is?

1049
01:28:05,095 --> 01:28:07,610
l'm hungry.

1050
01:28:09,335 --> 01:28:14,490
- Tell him. ls his blood good enough?
- He'll do just fine.

1051
01:28:15,896 --> 01:28:19,411
Forget it, Justice. Time's up.

1052
01:28:19,496 --> 01:28:23,727
lt's too late. lt's much too late.

1053
01:28:27,495 --> 01:28:30,408
This is your destiny.

1054
01:28:32,016 --> 01:28:34,086
And yours.

1055
01:28:36,176 --> 01:28:39,805
- Take him.
- Part of me loves you so much...

1056
01:28:55,897 --> 01:28:58,809
but that part of me must die.

1057
01:29:00,617 --> 01:29:03,051
lt must die.

1058
01:29:25,297 --> 01:29:30,008
l told you that you were...

1059
01:29:30,098 --> 01:29:32,736
a killer.

1060
01:30:06,019 --> 01:30:08,408
Come on, Rita, let's go. Come on!

1061
01:30:16,938 --> 01:30:19,089
Let's go!

1062
01:30:21,739 --> 01:30:23,092
We'll be OK!

1063
01:30:50,700 --> 01:30:52,815
Where did all...?

1064
01:30:58,540 --> 01:31:02,578
You did good, Rita. You OK?

1065
01:31:03,660 --> 01:31:05,332
Cross my heart...

1066
01:31:07,340 --> 01:31:09,296
and hope to die.

1067
01:31:24,060 --> 01:31:25,733
- Come on, let's go.
- l'm with you, G.

1068
01:31:25,821 --> 01:31:28,938
l gotta find myself a safer job.
Like the bomb squad.

1069
01:31:29,020 --> 01:31:31,535
Hey, Unc,
at least you got your health.

1070
01:31:31,620 --> 01:31:33,339
Well, thank you.

1071
01:31:33,420 --> 01:31:36,219
And at least you got your...

1072
01:31:36,300 --> 01:31:38,610
well, you know, you got...

1073
01:31:40,020 --> 01:31:44,458
- you got a limo.
- That's right! l got a limo!

1074
01:31:45,821 --> 01:31:48,176
l got the front seat, now.
Let me drive.

1075
01:31:48,261 --> 01:31:51,810
No more drivin' the limo for me.
My little ass is in the back.

1076
01:31:58,982 --> 01:32:00,300
Unc, talk to me.

1077
01:32:00,381 --> 01:32:04,215
Cruise control, power steering,
power brakes, power windows,

1078
01:32:04,301 --> 01:32:07,532
power seats
and we surrounded by leather.

1079
01:32:07,622 --> 01:32:10,181
Let's see what we got here.

1080
01:32:10,262 --> 01:32:14,652
Look at... Hey!
Some brother lost his mood ring.

1081
01:32:14,742 --> 01:32:19,770
Oh, shit. No.
No, man, this is Max's shit.

1082
01:32:19,862 --> 01:32:23,855
Max ain't gonna need this,
Max is spread out all over Brooklyn.

1083
01:32:23,942 --> 01:32:27,218
l'm gonna wear this
in great Max's honour.

1084
01:32:27,302 --> 01:32:30,578
We gotta represent
our homey the vampire.

1085
01:32:30,662 --> 01:32:34,575
- Hey, check it out. GQ or what?
- Macaroni.

1086
01:32:39,062 --> 01:32:42,419
Jesus, Mary, Little Bo Peep's Mom,
what's wrong?

1087
01:32:49,623 --> 01:32:52,296
Ain't no smoking in the limo, Julius.

1088
01:32:54,823 --> 01:32:58,736
Good God Almighty.
You done flip-flopped!

1089
01:32:58,823 --> 01:33:01,735
Shit! Unc! l got my shit back, man.

01:33:01,823 --> 01:33:04,098

1092
01:33:07,223 --> 01:33:09,054
Look at these fly shoes, man!

1093
01:33:10,863 --> 01:33:12,854
What?

1094
01:33:12,943 --> 01:33:17,221
Max said being a ghoul had benefits
but goddamn!

1095
01:33:17,303 --> 01:33:19,453
l ain't no ghoul!

1096
01:33:19,543 --> 01:33:23,253
Welcome to the party.
Now, let's get this show on the road.

1097
01:33:24,743 --> 01:33:28,418
- Well, you the boss.
- That's right.

1098
01:33:28,503 --> 01:33:32,941
There's a new vampire in Brooklyn
and his name's Julius Jones.

1099
01:33:36,624 --> 01:33:39,581
l ever tell you
l won the lndianapolis 500?

1100
01:33:39,664 --> 01:33:41,894
l beat a man called AJ Fittipaldi.

1101
01:33:43,224 --> 01:33:45,374
Yes, l used to
dress like that in '62.

1102
01:33:45,464 --> 01:33:49,616
- They called me Pretty Willie.
- Pretty Willie, drive the limo!

1103
01:33:49,704 --> 01:33:51,740
Oh, goddamn, man.

1104
